I am an undergraduate student majoring in Assistive Devices and Rehabilitation Engineering at Zhejiang Pharmaceutical University. I am currently a research intern at the Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences ，CAS.
My research interests focus on biomedical signal analysis and data-driven modeling for intelligent disease diagnosis, with particular emphasis on the application of electroencephalography (EEG) signals in the assessment of cognitive impairment and early disease detection, as well as the potential of speech signals for tpathological voice analysis based on speech signalsnd disorders.
In related research projects, I have been involved in non-stationary signal analysis, multidimensional feature extraction, and the application of deep learning methods to biomedical diagnostic tasks.
